    "description": "THK Home Help Service (HHS) is created to assist and support frail elderly to remain in their own homes for as long as possible, thereby enabling the elderly to age gracefully as well as to delay institutional care. Home Help Service also better known as \"Meals on Wheels\", providing packed healthy meals to these elderly.\n\nDo you know that some of the THK services run regardless of rain or shine? Even during this COVID-19 period, the staff of THK Home Care Home Help Division have to carry on with their services in order to help the people in need. The necessary precautions are taken to keep everyone safe. \n\nHowever, as most flights are cancelled, some foreign staff are unable to recommence work in Singapore. \n\nWith your support, our elderly will be able to continue to receive their packed-warm meals.",
